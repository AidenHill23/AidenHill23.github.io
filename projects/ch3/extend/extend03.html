            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>It is very important to use descriptive file names for image files so you will never have to worry about mixing them up. For example you could have 2 images, one has a man holding a basketball while the other one has a women holding a basketball. Imagine if you named the files basketball1 and basketball2. It would be hard to tell which one is different it would be better if you named them more discriptively.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used the website called "BiteAble".</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>It was 2100 by 1399.</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="Someone writing the words html 5 " height="150" width="150">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used the compressor named, "compressor.io" and the file size went from 12kb to 7kb.</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html_min.jpg" alt="Someone writing the words html 5 " height="150" width="150">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>The main difference is that the quality of the compressed image is worse than the quality of the original image.</p>

                <h3>SVG Graphics</h3>
                
                <!-- Insert your SVG code below this comment -->
               <svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
				<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
				</svg>
                
                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>I use the website w3 schools to learn more about svg images.</p>
